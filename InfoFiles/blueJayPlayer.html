        <i>Toronto Blue Jays Active Roster</i>
        <p>
            As each year the Blue Jays gain and loose members on their team it is always important
            to make sure you keep to update with what players are on what team.

            I personally check out https://www.mlb.com/bluejays/roster for all of the current players on the team.
