        <i>Toronto Blue Jays Logo</i>
        <p>
            One of the more noticeable parts of the Blue Jays is their logo. Even though 
            the logo design has changed throughout the years of them playing as a team 
            it always stuck with the same simmilar picture of the blue jay bird and it 
            has been a staple picture ever since.
